# Agent Development Kit (ADK)

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source, code-first Python framework for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents. It simplifies the creation and orchestration of agent workflows, supporting everything from simple tasks to complex multi-agent systems, while remaining model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic.

**Key Technologies/Frameworks:**
- Python
- Gemini (optimized)
- FastAPI (for web UI/API)
- Playwright (for browser automation tools)
- Vertex AI Code Execution Sandbox API
- A2A Protocol

**Main Features:**
- Rich Tool Ecosystem (pre-built, custom, OpenAPI, MCP)
- Code-First Development for agent logic and orchestration
- Agent Configuration without code
- Tool Confirmation (Human-in-the-Loop)
- Modular Multi-Agent System design
- Deployment to Cloud Run or Vertex AI Agent Engine
- Session Rewind and Agent Evaluation capabilities
- Built-in Development UI

**Architectural Patterns:**
- Modular Multi-Agent Systems
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication
- Code-First development paradigm
- Model and deployment agnosticism
- Reason-Act loop for agent execution
- Event-driven architecture for session management
